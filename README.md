## Development

+ `26-09-2025` - Added first tooltip to the live clock app `.live---clock`. We did have some hover effect on the live clock element.

+ `06-10-2025` - Learned more about the system needed to create multiiple tooltips above interactive elements and how to use them. Spent a lot of time as well working on its responsiveness; mainly the task of preventing the tooltip from overflowing the screen and causing a horizontal scroll.  The top banner is now in good shape.

+ `08-10-2025` - Finalised the live clock prototyping at least for this draft stage. I had a challenge today though to get the tooltip arrows correctly positioned for each tooltip.  Marking this as a future issue to be resolved.

+ `09-10-2025` -  Drafted most of the markup; attributes, classes and ID's needed for the interface. What's missing is the Weather API fetching and that's trickier because the fetching is dynamic and could return its own elements and attributes. So when I prototype the visual design, I'll save that for last.  

  + Specifically, I added a 4th icon for a 4th theme switcher option; reduced the size of the icon and made them more of a square with rounded corners.

  + I've added vertical scrolling in each dashboard panel so the content will never exceed its container. Plus, there's no visible scroll bar until it is needed.

  + Finally, I added a sticky footer will eventually allow the user easy access to visibility toggle buttons for the Dashboard panels.

+ `10-10-2025` - Added styling for the Todolist section - mimicking states for editable and edited states.

+ `13-10-2025` - Groundwork done for the rest of the dashboard panels. Created more extend directives for more common elements like buttons and icons.

+ `15-10-2025` - At this point, Every element has at least some styling applied and a functioning tooltip where appropriate. Now it's the time to do a top to bottom review and development of the UI of the app, looking to improve the readability and maintinability of the code as I go. 
  + At the end of this day, the UI looks a little more polished and more ready to be implemented with DOM Scripting. I think it needs one more day of configuring with SASS variables and then I'll be ready to start implementing the DOM Scripting and working out different visual themes with localstorage.

+ `16-10-2025` - On this day, I think I can say I've passed the point now of full focus on the UI and styling and will start focusing on implementation soon.  Any improvements to the visuals will now be made as and when needed.

  + There are some aspects that haven't yet been prototyped. In some cases, where I'll be adding new elements dynamically with JavaScript, I'll probably need modals to add information such as link text and link addresses before they can be added to the panel. So that's to come.
